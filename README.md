# Challenge_3

# I began by importing pandas, Path, and inline. 
# My next step will be to collect the data. 
  ## I've collected the data from bitstamp. 
  ## I've collected the data from coinbase. 
  ## After checking both were imported correctly.

# My next step is to prepare the data to make sure that it is clean.
  ## There were no missing values.
  ## There were no duplicated values. 
  ## I changed the "$" symbol to a "". 
  ## I had trouble converting the close column to a float. However, I beleive that the coloumn is already a float. 
  
# My next step is to analyze the data. 
  ## After my inital analysis of the data, I see that I did not change the "$". 
  ## I'm unsure where I went wrong here and will attempt to return to this later but in the interest of time I will move on. 
  ## After further analysis I am going back to see where I went wrong as now I see that my charts are coming out as a default bar       chart instead of the line. 

# I'm not sure why or what happened but I went wrong somewhere and it seemed my entire challenge was compromised as any graph I plotted comes out as a skinny bar graph and not a line. I am also unable to rectify the "attribute error". 
  ## I do not fully understand arbitrage at this point and along with the 14+ hours it took to get this far in the challenge. I         don't forsee this being a good use of my time as I am already very much behind. So I will turn in the challenge as is and         learn from any feedback.
