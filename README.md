# Challenge_3

# I began by importing pandas, Path, and inline. 
# My next step will be to collect the data. 
  ## I've collected the data from bitstamp. 
  ## I've collected the data from coinbase. 
  ## After checking both were imported correctly.

# My next step is to prepare the data to make sure that it is clean.
  ## There were no missing values.
  ## There were no duplicated values. 
  ## I changed the "$" symbol to a "". 
  ## I had trouble converting the close column to a float. However, I beleive that the coloumn is already a float. 
  
# My next step is to analyze the data. 
  ## After my inital analysis of the data, I see that I did not change the "$". 
  ## I'm unsure where I went wrong here and will attempt to return to this later but in the interest of time I will move on.
